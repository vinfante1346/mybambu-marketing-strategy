# 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS - Month 1

## **What Worked**

1. **Speed Matters** - Hiring support agents immediately (temp agency) vs slow full-time hire process
2. **Automation Pilot** - Testing with 100 users before full rollout prevented major issues
3. **Education Content** - 76% activation rate validated survey findings
4. **Influencer Authenticity** - Giving creative freedom > scripted content
5. **Daily Standups** - 15-min daily check-ins kept everyone aligned

## **What Didn't Work**

1. **Engineering Estimates** - Initial 1-week estimate became 2 weeks (always pad estimates)
2. **Content Production** - Freelance writers needed more guidance on tone/style
3. **Influencer Response Rate** - Only 20% of influencers responded to cold outreach
4. **Email Open Rates** - Spanish emails performed better than English (75% vs 55%)

## **What to Do Differently**

1. **Hire faster** - Use temp agencies for urgent needs
2. **Prototype before building** - Wireframe customer UI before engineering starts
3. **Warm intros** - Influencer outreach better through mutual connections
4. **Spanish-first** - Always write Spanish version first, then translate to English
