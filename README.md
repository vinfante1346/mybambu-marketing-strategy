   - *Mitigation:* Legal review before launch, budget $5K for counsel

### Medium Risks (Yellow)
4. **Content Quality** - Translated (not culturally adapted) content feels inauthentic
   - *Mitigation:* Hire native Spanish speaker, have 3 community members review

5. **Influencer Misalignment** - Partnered influencers create controversial content

## üéì Key Learnings & Philosophy

### 1. Spanish-First, Not English-Translated
Cultural adaptation > literal translation. Write for the heart, not just the head.

### 2. Show, Don't Tell
90-second video tutorial > 500-word FAQ. Eliminate friction at every step.

### 3. Family > Individual
Latino culture is collectivist. "Invita a tu familia" > "Refer a friend"

### 4. Start Manual, Automate Later
Validate campaigns work before building complex systems.

### 5. Measure What Matters
PPC-30 is the North Star. Everything else is a leading indicator.

### 6. Speed Wins
Every month of delay = $400K+ in lost LTV. Execute fast, optimize as you go.
