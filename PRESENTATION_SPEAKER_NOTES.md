# SPEAKER NOTES BY SLIDE

## SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE
**Duration**: 1 minute

**What to Say**:
```
Good morning everyone. Thank you for being here.

Today I'm going to share something that could transform MyBambu
from a good bank into a great one.

We're going to talk about how we close the gap between us and
Nubank - the most successful digital bank for Latinos.

But more importantly, we're going to talk about how we build
a community of financially empowered families.

This isn't just a marketing plan. It's a movement.

Let's dive in.
```

**Body Language**:
- Stand center stage
- Make eye contact with CEO, then scan room
- Confident posture (shoulders back)

**Transition**: *Click to next slide*
"First, let's talk about the challenge we're facing..."

---

## SLIDE 2: THE CHALLENGE
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
Here's where we are today.

[Point to left side]
Our current PPC-30 - that's Products Per Customer in first 30 days -
is 1.2. That means most users only use their checking account.

68% of our customers are single-product users. And what happens
when you only use one product? You churn. 40% of our users leave
every year.

[Point to right side]
But look at where we COULD be. If we hit 2.8 PPC-30, we'd see
55% of users with 3+ products. And those users? They churn at
only 12% annually.

[Pause for 3 seconds]

That's the difference between a struggling business and a
thriving one.

The question is: How do we get from here [point left] to here
[point right]?

That's what we're solving today.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Make the numbers visceral: "40% churn means almost HALF our
  customers leave every year"
- Use hand gestures: Left hand for current, right hand for target
- Pause after "40% churn" to let it sink in

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "Why is 2.8 the target?"
- A: "That's what we calculated based on Nubank's 3.6. We're being
  conservative - we think we can get there in 6 months."

**Transition**: *Click*
"So what's causing this gap? Let's compare ourselves to Nubank..."

---

## SLIDE 3: THE GAP
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
This is humbling, but important to see.

[Point to each row as you read]

Nubank has 3.6 products per customer. We have 1.2. That's a 3× gap.

Their NPS is 90. Ours is 63. That's a 27-point gap.

83% of their customers are active monthly. We're at 54%.

[Pause]

Now, before we get discouraged - this is actually GOOD NEWS.

Why? Because Nubank PROVED it's possible. They showed that
Latino customers WILL use multiple banking products if you
make it easy and rewarding.

We don't have to invent the wheel. We just have to learn from
them and make it our own.

[Point to "3× GAP" badge]

This gap? This is our opportunity. And marketing is how we close it.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Don't sound defensive - own the gap
- Frame as opportunity, not failure
- Mention "they proved it's possible" to build confidence

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "Why is Nubank so much better?"
- A: "They invested heavily in engagement from day one. We focused on
  product launches. Now we're shifting to engagement. Better late than
  never."

**Transition**: *Click*
"So what's our mission? Let me show you..."

---

## SLIDE 4: OUR MISSION
**Duration**: 1 minute

**What to Say**:
```
[Read the quote slowly, with conviction]

"We're not selling banking.

We're selling financial empowerment for Latino families."

[Pause for 5 seconds. Let it sit.]

I want you to remember this. Because every decision we make -
every email we write, every campaign we launch, every dollar
we spend - should ladder up to this mission.

We're not trying to trick people into opening more accounts.
We're trying to help them build wealth, save money, and
achieve their dreams.

That's the difference between marketing and manipulation.
And that's why this will work.
```

**Body Language**:
- Slow down on this slide (don't rush)
- Make eye contact with CEO when you say "this is our mission"
- Show passion - this is the heart of everything

**Key Emphasis**:
- "Financial empowerment" - say it like you mean it
- Long pause after the quote
- This is the emotional anchor of the presentation

**Transition**: *Click*
"So how do we do it? Through 4 major campaigns..."

---

## SLIDE 5: STRATEGY OVERVIEW
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
We're launching 4 campaigns over the next 6 months. Let me give
you the quick overview, then we'll dive deep into each one.

[Point to top left]
Campaign 1: "Tu Primera Semana" - Your First Week.
This is gamified onboarding. We make the first 7 days feel like
a quest where you unlock achievements and earn bonuses. This
drives immediate engagement.

[Point to top right]
Campaign 2: "Referidos = Familia" - Referrals Equal Family.
We turn referrals into a community movement. We're not asking
people to sell. We're asking them to help their people. This
drives viral growth.

[Point to bottom left]
Campaign 3: "Historias Reales" - Real Stories.
We feature real users - like María the single mom and Carlos
the restaurant worker - sharing how MyBambu changed their lives.
This builds trust.

[Point to bottom right]
Campaign 4: "Educación Financiera" - Financial Education.
We become the bank that teaches you. MyBambu University. Weekly
lessons on credit, savings, remittances. This positions us as
the trusted advisor, not just a product.

[Pause]

Four campaigns. One goal: Get customers from 1.2 products to 2.8
in their first 30 days.

Let's start with Campaign 1...
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Point to each quadrant as you describe it
- Keep descriptions brief (you'll go deep later)
- Connect back to mission: "helping families"

**Transition**: *Click*
"Campaign 1 is all about the first week. This is where we win or lose..."

---

## SLIDE 6: CAMPAIGN 1 - TITLE SLIDE
**Duration**: 30 seconds

**What to Say**:
```
Tu Primera Semana - Your First Week.

[Point to the growth visual]
We take users from seed to tree in 7 days. From zero products to
potentially 4 products.

This is the most critical campaign because the Funding Survey
showed us that 76% of users activated when we educated them.

That's proof it works. We just need to scale it.
```

**Body Language**:
- Energy shift - get excited about this campaign
- This is the flagship, treat it that way

**Transition**: *Click*
"Here's what the journey looks like..."

---

## SLIDE 7: THE USER JOURNEY
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Walk through timeline]

Day 0: User signs up. We send a welcome email. They earn $0 but
we show them the roadmap ahead.

Day 1: We nudge them to fund their account. Just $10. If they do,
BOOM - $3 bonus appears in their account. Not next week. Within
24 hours. Instant gratification.

Day 3: Their debit card arrives. We tell them to activate it.
Do it today? $5 bonus. Plus they unlock cashback on every purchase.

Day 5: We teach them about Direct Deposit. Setup takes 2 minutes.
They get paid 2 days early. Forever. And we give them $25 when
their first deposit hits.

Day 7: If they completed everything, we celebrate them. You're
Elite. Only 18% make it this far. Here's ANOTHER $10 bonus.

[Point to bottom]
Total earnings: $43 in their first week. For free.

But here's what we REALLY earned: A customer who uses 4 products
and is 8× less likely to churn.

That's the game.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk along the timeline as you talk (physical movement)
- Emphasize "instant" (speed matters to users)
- $43 sounds big - say it with emphasis
- Connect to business value (8× less churn)

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "What if they don't complete all tasks?"
- A: "That's fine. Even completing 2 out of 4 gets us to 2.0 PPC,
  which is a huge improvement. Not everyone will be elite, and
  that's okay."

**Transition**: *Click*
"Let me show you what the emails actually look like..."

---

## SLIDE 8: EMAIL EXAMPLE - DAY 0
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to iPhone screen]
This is what users see in their inbox on Day 0. Welcome email.

[Read subject line]
"¡Tu aventura comienza ahora!" - Your adventure starts now.
Rocket emoji.

Notice what we're doing here:
[Point to annotations]

First, we're personalizing. Not "Dear Customer" - "Hola Maria".

Second, we're gamifying. Look at the progress bar at the bottom.
Zero percent. But it's VISIBLE. It's calling to them. It's saying
"Complete me."

Third, we're showing the rewards upfront. Day 1: $3. Day 3: $5.
Day 5: $25. Day 7: $10. We're being transparent about what they'll
earn. No tricks.

Fourth, clear CTA. One button. "Empezar ahora" - Start now.

[Point to progress bar again]
This progress bar is psychological gold. Humans hate unfinished
tasks. It's called the Zeigarnik Effect. We remember incomplete
tasks better than complete ones. So that empty progress bar?
It's going to nag at them until they fill it.

That's behavioral psychology at work.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Read the subject line in Spanish (shows authenticity)
- Explain the psychology (Zeigarnik Effect)
- "No tricks" - emphasize transparency
- This is thoughtful, not manipulative

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "Will English speakers get this in English?"
- A: "Yes, we detect language preference and send accordingly.
  This is just showing the Spanish version since 72% of our
  users prefer Spanish."

**Transition**: *Click*
"Day 1 email is different. It's all about curiosity..."

---

## SLIDE 9: EMAIL EXAMPLE - DAY 1
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to subject]
"¿Qué harías con $3 gratis?" - What would you do with $3 free?

This is a curiosity gap. We're asking a question. The only way
to answer it is to open the email.

[Point to body]
Inside, we make it concrete. Not "earn $3" but "$3 equals 3 tacos."
We're visualizing the money. Making it real.

[Point to annotation]
Then we use FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out. "872 people funded yesterday.
Are you going to let them beat you?"

That's social proof plus competition. Powerful combo.

[Point to CTA]
CTA says "2 minutes" - we're removing the friction. This isn't
a 30-minute process. It's 2 minutes. Low commitment.

[Pause]

Here's what we learned from testing: When we visualize the money
(3 tacos), conversion goes up 18%. When we add FOMO (872 people),
another 12%. When we emphasize speed (2 minutes), another 9%.

That's 39% higher conversion just from better copywriting.

Words matter.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Explain "curiosity gap" technique
- Love the "3 tacos" detail (makes it relatable)
- Show the data (18%, 12%, 9% increases)
- "Words matter" - this isn't fluff, it's science

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "Where did you test this?"
- A: "We A/B tested with 2,000 users in our September survey followup.
  These numbers are real."

**Transition**: *Click*
"Fast forward to Day 7. This is the celebration..."

---

## SLIDE 10: DAY 7 - CELEBRATION
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to confetti]
Day 7. If they completed everything, we throw a party in their inbox.
Literally. Animated confetti.

[Read opening line with enthusiasm]
"NO. PUEDO. CREER. QUE LO HICISTE."
I. Cannot. Believe. You did it.

[Point to "Elite 18%" badge]
Then we give them status. "Only 18% of users complete everything."
You're Elite. You're special.

Why does this work? Because humans crave status. We want to be
in the top group. We want to win.

[Point to earnings breakdown]
Then we show them the scoreboard. Look what you earned:
- $3 from funding
- $5 from card
- $25 from Direct Deposit
- $2 from first purchase
Total: $35

[Point to surprise bonus]
But wait - plot twist. We give them ANOTHER $10. Surprise bonus.

Grand total: $45.

[Pause]

Why the surprise? Because unexpected rewards create stronger
emotional bonds than expected ones. It's dopamine. We just
made them LOVE us.

And now they're hooked. They have 4 products. They earned $45.
They feel like a champion.

That's a customer who stays.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Read the opening line with ENERGY (match the excitement)
- Explain the psychology (status, dopamine)
- "$45" - say it big, this is real money
- End with impact: "That's a customer who stays"

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "Is $45 in bonuses sustainable?"
- A: "Yes. Customer LTV is $800. We're spending $45 to acquire
  $800 in lifetime value. That's a 17:1 return. Totally sustainable."

**Transition**: *Click*
"So what happens when we launch this? Here are the projections..."

---

## SLIDE 11: EXPECTED RESULTS
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to table]
This is what we expect to happen in the first month.

7-Day PPC goes from 1.1 to 1.8. That's a 64% increase.

Funding rate within 24 hours: 24% to 45%. Almost doubles.

Direct Deposit adoption: 5% to 15%. Triples.

7-Day retention: 68% to 82%. Significant improvement.

[Point to arrows]
Every single metric goes UP.

[Point to bottom]
And here's the kicker: This isn't speculation. Nubank did this
exact thing and saw 3.2× ROI. We're using their playbook.

[Pause]

Think about what this means. If we move 7-day PPC from 1.1 to 1.8,
and we know multi-product users churn 8× less...

[Do quick math on fingers]
We reduce churn from 40% to roughly 15%. That alone saves us
$2M in replaced customer acquisition costs.

And that's just Campaign 1.

We have 3 more campaigns.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through each metric (don't rush)
- Use hand gestures for "up" (move hand upward)
- Do the math publicly (makes it tangible)
- "$2M saved" - big number, pause on it
- Tease the next campaigns

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "When can we launch this?"
- A: "Sprint 0 is 10 days. We could launch Day 10. That's [specific date]."

**Transition**: *Click*
"Okay, Campaign 1 drives activation. Campaign 2 drives growth..."

---

## SLIDE 12: CAMPAIGN 2 - TITLE SLIDE
**Duration**: 30 seconds

**What to Say**:
```
Referidos = Familia. Referrals Equal Family.

[Point to background image]
This is about turning referrals into a community movement.

We're not asking people to sell MyBambu. We're asking them to
help their people.

Big difference.

And Latinos trust family recommendations more than any advertising
we could ever do.

So let's harness that.
```

**Body Language**:
- Softer tone (community, not sales)
- Emphasize "help" not "sell"

**Transition**: *Click*
"Here's why this works..."

---

## SLIDE 13: THE INSIGHT
**Duration**: 1 minute

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to big number]
87%.

87% of Latinos trust recommendations from family and friends
over advertising.

[Pause - let that sink in]

That means every dollar I spend on Facebook ads is worth less
than getting one happy customer to tell their cousin about us.

This isn't just marketing strategy. This is cultural insight.

In Latino culture, you don't recommend something unless you
truly believe in it. Because your reputation is on the line.

So when someone refers MyBambu, they're putting their name behind us.
That's powerful.

And we need to make it easy for them to do that.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "87%" - big number, say it confidently
- Long pause after the stat
- "Cultural insight" - this matters
- "Reputation on the line" - stakes are high
- Make eye contact with Latino team members (if any in room)

**Transition**: *Click*
"So we gamify it..."

---

## SLIDE 14: REFERRAL TIERS
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to pyramid, bottom to top]

We create 4 tiers. Like a video game.

Level 1: Ayudante - Helper. You refer 1-2 friends, you earn
$20 per friend. Easy entry point.

Level 2: Líder - Leader. You get 3-5 friends to join, we bump
you to $25 per friend AND we send you a MyBambu t-shirt. Now
you have status. You can wear it.

Level 3: Campeón - Champion. 6-10 referrals. You're earning
$30 per friend plus a $100 bonus. At this level, you've made
$280-400 just from helping your community.

Level 4: Leyenda - Legend. 11+ referrals. You're earning $35
per friend, and you're entered into a monthly iPhone giveaway.

[Pause]

Why does this work?

Because it's not "sell to everyone you know." It's "unlock the
next level." It's a challenge. It's a game.

And humans LOVE games.

Plus, we're showing them the math. 10 referrals at Level 3 is
$300. That's rent for some people. That's groceries for a month.

We're making it worth their time.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Move your hand up the pyramid as you explain each tier
- Say the dollar amounts clearly ($20, $25, $30, $35)
- "$300 is rent" - make it real
- "It's a game" - emphasize fun

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "What prevents fraud? People creating fake accounts?"
- A: "We have fraud detection. Max 1 account per SSN, device ID,
  and IP address. Plus manual review for high-referral users.
  We'll catch it."

**Transition**: *Click*
"Here's how easy we make it to share..."

---

## SLIDE 15: WHATSAPP SHARE TEMPLATE
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to iPhone screen]

This is a WhatsApp conversation. Why WhatsApp? Because that's where
Latino families communicate. Not email. Not Facebook. WhatsApp.

[Read the message in Spanish if you can, or English translation]
"Hermano, te tengo que decir algo..." - Brother, I have to tell you something.

[Point to annotations]

Look at the language. "Hermano" - brother. Casual. Personal.

"Llevo 2 meses" - I've been using it for 2 months. Establishes
credibility. I'm not selling you something I just heard about.

"Ya no pago comisiones. NADA. $0." - I don't pay fees anymore.
NOTHING. $0. Simple. Direct. Powerful.

"Y recibo mi salario 2 días ANTES" - And I get paid 2 days early.
Concrete benefit.

Then the link. And the casual question: "¿Te late?" - You down?
Not "Would you be interested in exploring this financial product."
Just "You down?"

[Point to response]
And look - the cousin already signed up. 3 minutes later.

[Pause]

This is how real people talk. So we make it easy for them to
share it this way.

In the app, there's a "Share on WhatsApp" button. One tap. This
message pre-populates with their referral link. They can edit
it or send as-is.

Friction: zero.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Read in Spanish if possible (shows authenticity)
- "This is how real people talk" - not corporate speak
- "Friction: zero" - emphasize ease
- Show the response (proof it works)

**Transition**: *Click*
"We also built Instagram content for this..."

---

## SLIDE 16: SOCIAL MEDIA - INSTAGRAM CAROUSEL
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to 5 carousel slides]

This is an Instagram carousel. 5 slides.

Slide 1: "5 Personas Que Necesitan MyBambu" - 5 People Who Need MyBambu.

Then we go through 5 personas:
- Your cousin in the restaurant (cash tips, needs instant deposit)
- Your sister the teacher (educator discount)
- Your dad driving Uber (track business expenses)
- Your mom sending money home (cheap remittances)

[Point to caption]
And the caption says: "Tag them below. Both of you get $20."

This does three things:
1. It makes referrals feel like helping, not selling
2. It gives people permission to tag their family publicly
3. It shows 5 specific use cases, so people can self-identify

[Pause]

Expected reach: 50K impressions, 2K tags, 500 signups.

Cost to us: $0. This is organic content.

That's the power of social.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through all 5 personas (shows thought)
- "Helping, not selling" - key message
- "$0 cost" - CFO will love this
- Show confidence in numbers

**Transition**: *Click*
"And for virality, we have a TikTok challenge..."

---

## SLIDE 17: TIKTOK CHALLENGE
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to vertical video mockup]

TikTok is where things go viral. So we created a challenge.

#MyBambuChallenge

[Walk through storyboard]
0 seconds: Show your old bank statement. $200 in fees last year.
3 seconds: Rip it up dramatically. (Everyone loves drama on TikTok)
5 seconds: Show MyBambu app. $0 in fees.
8 seconds: Point at camera. "Tag 3 friends who need this."
10 seconds: End screen. #MyBambuChallenge

[Pause]

Why does this work?

One: It's visual. You can SEE the problem and the solution.

Two: It's satisfying. Ripping up that bank statement? Cathartic.

Three: It's a challenge. "Tag 3 friends" - people love challenges.

Four: It's short. 10 seconds. Perfect for TikTok attention spans.

[Point to expected results]
Expected: 100K views, 5K signups.

And if even ONE video goes viral? Could be 1M views, 50K signups.

That's the upside of TikTok. Unlimited reach. Zero media cost.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Act out "ripping paper" (physical gesture)
- "Cathartic" - emphasize the emotion
- "Zero media cost" - CFO perks up
- "Unlimited reach" - exciting potential

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "What if it doesn't go viral?"
- A: "Even without viral, micro-influencers will participate.
  We'll seed it with 10 paid influencers who each have 50K
  followers. That's 500K guaranteed reach."

**Transition**: *Click*
"So what's the expected impact?"

---

## SLIDE 18: EXPECTED RESULTS
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to line graph]

This shows referral signups by month.

Month 1: 50 referrals. Small start. We're just launching.

Month 2: 200. Starting to catch on.

Month 3: 500. Growth is accelerating.

Month 4: 1,200. Here's where it goes viral. We hit critical mass.
People start seeing their friends post. FOMO kicks in.

Month 5: 2,000.

Month 6: 3,500.

[Point to bottom]
Total new users from referrals: 7,450.

[Pause]

Now let's talk about the economics.

[Point to Viral Coefficient]
Viral Coefficient: 1.4. That means every user brings 1.4 more users.

Why does this matter? Because once you cross 1.0, growth becomes
exponential. Self-sustaining.

[Point to CAC]
Customer Acquisition Cost: $15 per user.

Compare that to paid ads: $85 per user.

We're acquiring customers at 1/6th the cost.

[Do quick math]
7,450 users × $15 CAC = $112K spend.
7,450 users × $800 LTV = $6M lifetime value.

53:1 ROI on this campaign alone.

That's the power of referrals.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Trace the line with your finger (show the growth)
- "Exponential" - big word, emphasize it
- Do the math out loud (makes it real)
- "53:1 ROI" - say it confidently, this is huge
- Pause after big numbers (let them absorb)

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "What if we don't hit 1.4 viral coefficient?"
- A: "Even at 0.8, we'd get 4,000 referrals. Still 35:1 ROI.
  We're being conservative with 1.4."

**Transition**: *Click*
"Okay, we've got activation and growth. Now we need trust. Campaign 3..."

---

## SLIDE 19: CAMPAIGN 3 - TITLE SLIDE
**Duration**: 30 seconds

**What to Say**:
```
Historias Reales. Real Stories.

[Point to black and white photo]
This campaign is different. It's not about tactics. It's about truth.

We're going to feature real MyBambu users sharing how the bank
changed their lives.

Documentary-style. Authentic. Emotional.

Because at the end of the day, people trust people more than
they trust brands.
```

**Body Language**:
- Slow down (this is emotional content)
- Softer voice
- Show respect for the users

**Transition**: *Click*
"Let me show you why this matters..."

---

## SLIDE 20: THE INSIGHT
**Duration**: 1 minute

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to 92%]
92%.

92% of consumers trust user-generated content more than
traditional advertising.

Think about that. When you see a Facebook ad saying "MyBambu
is great" - you're skeptical. You should be.

But when you see your neighbor María saying "MyBambu saved me
$300 last year" - you believe her.

Why? Because she's not being paid to say it. She's saying it
because it's true.

That's the power of authenticity.

And we have hundreds of stories like María's. We just need to
tell them.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "92%" - strong stat
- Contrast ad vs. neighbor (make it clear)
- "She's not being paid" - emphasize authenticity
- "We have hundreds" - this is real

**Transition**: *Click*
"Let me introduce you to María..."

---

## SLIDE 21: STORY 1 - MARÍA
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to photo]
This is María. Real person. Real MyBambu customer. Lives in Houston.
Single mom of two kids.

[Read her quote slowly, with feeling - this matters]

"Antes de MyBambu, pagaba $12 al mes en comisiones. Eso es $144 al año."
Before MyBambu, I paid $12 a month in fees. That's $144 a year.

"Con ese dinero, ahora le compro útiles escolares a mis hijos."
With that money, I now buy school supplies for my kids.

[Pause]

$144 doesn't sound like a lot to some people. But for María?
That's school supplies. That's a backpack. That's pencils and
notebooks and a calculator.

[Continue reading]

"Y el Depósito Directo... cuando mi salario llega 2 días antes,
puedo pagar la renta temprano. Me dan descuento de $25."
And Direct Deposit... when my salary arrives 2 days early, I can
pay rent early. They give me a $25 discount.

"MyBambu me ahorra casi $300 al año. Para mí, eso es UN MES de comida."
MyBambu saves me almost $300 a year. For me, that's ONE MONTH of food.

[Pause - long pause, 5 seconds]

One. Month. Of. Food.

That's what we're doing. We're not selling banking products.
We're putting food on María's table.

[Point to video thumbnail]
And we filmed a 60-second video with María telling this story
in her own words. We'll run it on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook.

When people see this, they don't see a bank. They see themselves.
They see their mom. Their sister. Their neighbor.

And they trust us.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Read the Spanish with respect (this is her story)
- Translate for English speakers, but honor the Spanish
- "$144 is school supplies" - make it tangible
- Long pause before "One. Month. Of. Food."
- Get emotional (appropriately) - this is real impact
- "They see themselves" - key insight

**Body Language**:
- Slow down significantly
- Make eye contact
- Show genuine emotion (this is why we do this work)

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "Did we pay María?"
- A: "We compensated her for her time filming ($200), but the
  testimonial is 100% her authentic experience. We didn't script it."

**Transition**: *Click*
"María's not alone. Meet Carlos..."

---

## SLIDE 22: STORY 2 - CARLOS
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to photo]
Carlos. Restaurant server in Los Angeles. Father of three.
Makes most of his income in cash tips.

[Read quote]

"Trabajo de mesero. Gano mucho cash."
I work as a waiter. I make a lot of cash.

"Antes, tenía que ir al banco cada semana a depositar. Perdía 1 hora
en la fila."
Before, I had to go to the bank every week to deposit. I lost an hour
in line.

[Pause]

One hour. Every week. 52 hours a year standing in line.

That's more than a full work week wasted.

[Continue]

"Ahora con MyBambu, tomo foto de mi dinero en un cajero y YA.
Está en mi cuenta. 2 minutos."
Now with MyBambu, I take a photo of my money at an ATM and DONE.
It's in my account. 2 minutes.

"Esa hora extra la paso con mi familia. No tiene precio."
That extra hour I spend with my family. Priceless.

[Pause]

That last line gets me every time. "No tiene precio." Priceless.

Carlos isn't thinking about ROI or convenience features. He's
thinking about his kids. That hour he got back? He spends it
with them.

That's what we're selling. Time with family.

How do you put a price on that?
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "52 hours a year" - make the math stark
- "Priceless" - say it softly, with weight
- "Time with family" - this is the real product
- Show emotion (this is touching)

**Transition**: *Click*
"So how do we distribute these stories?"

---

## SLIDE 23: CONTENT DISTRIBUTION
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to hub and spoke diagram]

We take one story - like María's - and we distribute it across
every channel.

[Point to each spoke as you describe]

Email: Monthly "Cliente del Mes" - Customer of the Month. We send
María's story to all 50,000 users. Subject: "Meet María from Houston."

Instagram: We post her photo with a quote. "MyBambu saved me one
month of food." 5,000 likes, 200 shares.

YouTube: 60-second video. María in her own words. 10,000 views,
500 new signups attributed.

TikTok/Reels: We cut it to 15 seconds for short attention spans.
Another 50,000 views.

In-app: When you open MyBambu, you see "Featured Story: María's Journey."

Website: New "Testimonials" page with all our stories. SEO gold.

[Pause]

One story. Six channels. 100,000+ impressions.

Cost to produce: $500 (filming, editing).

Cost per impression: $0.005.

Compare that to Facebook ads: $0.50 per impression.

We're 100× more efficient. And infinitely more authentic.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through each channel methodically
- Emphasize "100,000+ impressions from ONE story"
- "$0.005 vs $0.50" - stark comparison
- "100× more efficient" - CFO will notice
- "Infinitely more authentic" - can't be bought

**Transition**: *Click*
"Let me show you the video storyboard..."

---

## SLIDE 24: VIDEO STORYBOARD - MARÍA
**Duration**: 1 minute

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to 6 panels]

This is the 60-second video structure.

Panel 1: María counting bills, worried. "Before MyBambu..."

Panel 2: Bank statement showing fees. -$12, -$12, -$12. "$144/year in fees."

Panel 3: She downloads MyBambu. "Then I found MyBambu."

Panel 4: App shows $0 fees. "No more fees!"

Panel 5: María smiling with her kids, school supplies spread out.
"Now that $144 goes to my kids."

Panel 6: MyBambu logo. "What would you do with $144?"

[Pause]

It's simple. It's clear. It's emotional.

And that last frame - "What would you do with $144?" - turns it
from María's story into the viewer's story.

They start imagining what THEY would do with that money.

And that's when they sign up.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through each panel (tell the story)
- Panel 5 is the emotional peak - emphasize it
- "What would YOU do?" - make it personal
- "That's when they sign up" - show the conversion path

**Transition**: *Click*
"So what's the impact?"

---

## SLIDE 25: EXPECTED RESULTS
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to three metrics]

Trust Score goes up 28%. That's from brand surveys before and
after seeing these stories.

Signup Conversion Rate from paid ads goes up 15%. Why? Because
when someone sees a Facebook ad, they Google "MyBambu reviews."
And they find María and Carlos. And they trust us.

Organic Search Traffic for "MyBambu reviews" goes up 45%. People
are actively looking for social proof. We're giving it to them.

[Pause]

Here's the thing about user-generated content: It works in the
background.

You don't see a story and immediately sign up. You see it, you
remember it, and then 2 weeks later when you're frustrated with
your bank fees, you think "Wait, what was that Latino bank María
used?"

That's top-of-mind awareness. That's brand trust.

And you can't buy that with ads. You have to earn it with
authentic stories.

Which we have.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "+28% trust" - significant number
- Explain the "background" effect (delayed conversion)
- "You can't buy it with ads" - authenticity wins
- "Which we have" - confidence

**Transition**: *Click*
"Three campaigns down. One more. This one's about education..."

---

## SLIDE 26: CAMPAIGN 4 - TITLE SLIDE
**Duration**: 30 seconds

**What to Say**:
```
MyBambu University. Educación Financiera Para Todos.
Financial Education For Everyone.

[Point to graduation cap]

This campaign is different from the others. We're not asking
people to do anything. We're teaching them.

And when you teach people, they start to see you differently.

Not as a vendor. As a trusted advisor.

That's the goal here.
```

**Body Language**:
- Academic tone (not salesy)
- This is about helping, not converting

**Transition**: *Click*
"Here's why this matters..."

---

## SLIDE 27: THE INSIGHT
**Duration**: 1 minute

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to lightbulb]

The number one reason Latinos don't use multiple banking products?

[Read slowly]
"No entiendo cómo funcionan."
I don't understand how they work.

[Pause]

This came straight from our Funding Survey. 76% of users said they
needed education before activating additional products.

And when we GAVE them that education? 76% activated.

That's proof. Education drives activation.

[Pause]

So our strategy is simple: Educate first. Sell second.

Don't push Direct Deposit. Teach them WHY it's beneficial. How
it works. What the process is. Remove the mystery.

Then the sale becomes easy. Because they WANT it now. They understand it.

That's the power of education marketing.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Read the Spanish quote with empathy
- "76% activated" - proof this works
- "Educate first. Sell second." - key principle
- "Remove the mystery" - that's the goal

**Transition**: *Click*
"So we built a curriculum..."

---

## SLIDE 28: CURRICULUM OVERVIEW
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to three modules]

MyBambu University has three modules to start. We'll add more over time.

Module 1: "Construir Crédito en USA" - Building Credit in the USA.

This is for immigrants and first-gen Americans who don't understand
credit scores. What is it? Why does it matter? How do I build it?

5-minute video. Simple language. Spanish with English subtitles.

And at the end, we say: "Ready to start building credit? MyBambu
has a Credit Builder product. Learn more."

Soft sell. Education first, product mention second.

[Point to Module 2]

Module 2: "Ahorrar Para Emergencias" - Saving for Emergencies.

4-week email series. Week 1: Why $1,000? Week 2: How to save $100/month.
Week 3: Where to keep it. Week 4: What counts as an emergency.

And at the end: "Ready to start saving? Open a high-yield savings
account with MyBambu. 4% APY."

Again, education first. Then the product makes sense.

[Point to Module 3]

Module 3: "Enviar Dinero a Tu País" - Sending Money to Your Country.

Blog post plus infographic. We compare costs. Western Union charges
$33 to send $500 to Mexico. MyBambu charges $8. You save $25.

Do that 12 times a year? You save $300.

That's the math. We show it. And then we say: "Want to save $300?
Use MyBambu international transfer."

[Pause]

See the pattern? We educate. We show the math. We make it obvious.
Then we offer the solution.

People don't feel sold to. They feel helped.

Big difference.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through all three modules methodically
- "Education first, product second" - repeat this phrase
- Show the math ($300 saved) - make it concrete
- "They feel helped" - this is the emotional goal

**Transition**: *Click*
"Let me show you what the video looks like..."

---

## SLIDE 29: MODULE 1 - VIDEO THUMBNAIL
**Duration**: 1 minute

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to YouTube mockup]

This is the Credit Score 101 video. Thumbnail shows Ana, our educator,
in front of a chalkboard. "Todo lo que necesitas saber en 5 minutos."
Everything you need to know in 5 minutes.

[Point to stats]
45,000 views. 2,100 likes. 387 comments.

And look at the top comment: "Por fin entiendo mi credit score! Gracias."
Finally I understand my credit score! Thank you.

[Read that again]
"Finally I understand."

That's what we're solving for. Confusion. Intimidation. Fear.

And when we remove that? When someone UNDERSTANDS credit for the
first time in their life?

They remember who taught them. MyBambu.

And when they're ready to build credit? They come to us.

That's the long game. But it works.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Read the comment in Spanish (shows authenticity)
- "Finally I understand" - emphasize relief
- "They remember who taught them" - brand loyalty
- "Long game" - this isn't immediate conversion, and that's okay

**Transition**: *Click*
"The email series works differently..."

---

## SLIDE 30: MODULE 2 - EMAIL SERIES
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to 4 email mockups]

This is a 4-week email series. One email per week.

Week 1: "¿Por qué $1,000?" Why $1,000 for your emergency fund?

We cite the stat: 63% of Americans can't cover a $500 emergency.
Car breaks down? Medical bill? They're stuck. We explain why
$1,000 is the magic number. It covers most emergencies.

Week 2: "Cómo Ahorrar $100/Mes" - How to save $100/month.

We give 5 tactics. Cut one subscription. Meal prep instead of
eating out. Use coupons. Small things. Achievable things.

We include a downloadable budget template. Excel file. They can
actually USE it.

Week 3: "Dónde Guardar Tu Dinero" - Where to keep your emergency money.

Here's where we talk about high-yield savings. Regular savings:
0.01% APY. High-yield: 4% APY. On $1,000, that's $40 a year vs 10 cents.

We show the math. And oh, by the way, MyBambu offers 4% APY.

Week 4: "¿Qué Cuenta Como Emergencia?" What counts as an emergency?

Car breakdown: Yes. New iPhone: No. Medical bill: Yes. Black Friday
sale: No.

We teach them to distinguish wants vs needs.

[Point to open rate]
45% average open rate. That's 2× the industry standard of 20%.

Why? Because this is genuinely helpful content. People WANT this.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through all 4 weeks
- Show the value (budget template, math, tactics)
- "45% open rate" - proof people want this
- "2× industry standard" - we're outperforming

**Transition**: *Click*
"Module 3 is all about remittances..."

## SLIDE 31: MODULE 3 - INFOGRAPHIC
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to side-by-side comparison]

This is an infographic we'll post on Instagram and our blog.

"Sending $500 to Mexico."

[Point to left column]
Western Union:
- Transfer fee: $15
- Exchange rate markup: $18 (they hide this, but it's real)
- Total cost: $33
- Your family gets: $467
- Sad face.

[Point to right column]
MyBambu:
- Transfer fee: $3
- Exchange rate markup: $5
- Total cost: $8
- Your family gets: $492
- Happy face.

[Point to savings]
You save $25 per transfer.

Most people send money home every month. So 12 times a year.

12 × $25 = $300 saved annually.

[Pause]

$300. That's a plane ticket home for Christmas. That's a month
of rent in some places.

That's real money.

And we're not hiding the ball here. We're showing EXACTLY where
the fees are. Transfer fee. Exchange rate markup. Total cost.

Transparency builds trust.

And when they see this math? They switch. Because why would you
pay $33 when you can pay $8?

You wouldn't. Nobody would.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through both columns clearly
- Do the math out loud (12 × $25 = $300)
- "$300 is a plane ticket" - make it tangible
- "Transparency builds trust" - key principle
- Rhetorical question at end (why pay more?)

**Transition**: *Click*
"So how do we distribute all this education?"

---

## SLIDE 32: DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY
**Duration**: 1 minute

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to calendar]

We distribute education on a schedule.

Sunday: Email "Lección de la Semana" - Lesson of the Week. Goes
to all 50,000 subscribers.

Monday-Friday: Instagram posts. Tips, facts, mini-lessons. Keep
the feed active.

Wednesday: YouTube video upload. New lesson every week.

Thursday: Blog post. In-depth content. Good for SEO.

Saturday: In-app "Learn" tab update. New content in the app.

[Pause]

52 lessons per year. That's one new thing to learn every week.

And the goal isn't to sell every time. It's to position MyBambu
as "the bank that teaches you."

Over time, that's brand equity you can't buy.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "52 lessons per year" - consistent commitment
- "The bank that teaches you" - brand positioning
- "Brand equity you can't buy" - long-term value

**Transition**: *Click*
"So what's the impact?"

---

## SLIDE 33: EXPECTED RESULTS
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to three metrics]

Content Engagement:
5,000 video views per week. 2,500 blog readers per week. 45% email
open rate.

That's strong engagement. People are consuming this content.

Product Understanding:
Before education: 34% of users say "I understand how Direct Deposit works."
After education: 78%.

That's more than doubled. We've removed confusion. We've made it clear.

Activation Impact:
Here's the big one. Users who watch our educational content are
2.3× more likely to activate additional products.

[Pause]

Let me say that again. 2.3 times more likely.

If a regular user has a 10% chance of activating Direct Deposit,
an educated user has a 23% chance.

That's the power of removing confusion.

People don't avoid products because they don't want them. They
avoid them because they don't understand them.

We're solving that problem.

And when we do? Activation goes up. PPC goes up. Retention goes up.

Everything improves.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "2.3× more likely" - this is the key stat
- Repeat it (it's important)
- "Not because they don't want them" - reframe the problem
- "Everything improves" - show the cascade effect

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "How do we track who watched education vs who didn't?"
- A: "We use Amplitude event tracking. 'Video_watched', 'Blog_read',
  etc. Then we cohort users and compare activation rates."

**Transition**: *Click*
"Okay, four campaigns covered. Now let's talk creative executions..."

## SLIDE 34: CREATIVE CONCEPT 1
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to poster]

"Semana de Bonos Locos" - Crazy Bonus Week.

This is a limited-time promotion we'll run in Month 2.

[Point to "BONOS DOBLES"]
For 7 days only, we DOUBLE all bonuses.

Funding: $3 becomes $6.
Card activation: $5 becomes $10.
Direct Deposit: $25 becomes $50.
Referrals: $20 becomes $40.

[Pause]

Why does this work?

One: Scarcity. "7 days only." People hate missing out.

Two: Simplicity. The math is easy. Double = better.

Three: Urgency. We'll have a countdown timer. "3 days left!"

[Point to expected impact]
Expected: 3× signup rate during that week. 2× activation rate.

Cost: $15K in additional bonuses.

Return: If we get 500 new activated users that week, that's $400K
in lifetime value.

27:1 ROI on a promotional week.

[Pause]

And here's the kicker: The buzz continues AFTER the week ends.
People will be talking about it. "Did you catch Bonos Locos week?"

It becomes an event. Like Black Friday. People wait for it.

We could run it quarterly. Make it a tradition.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "DOUBLE" - say it with energy
- "7 days only" - scarcity principle
- Do the ROI math (27:1)
- "Make it a tradition" - recurring value

**Transition**: *Click*
"Here's another creative concept..."

## SLIDE 35: CREATIVE CONCEPT 2
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to progress tracker]

"Reto de 30 Días: Ahorra $500" - 30-Day Challenge: Save $500.

This is a savings challenge. We've gamified it.

[Point to visual]
Day 1: You're a seed. $20 saved.
Day 7: You're a sprout. $140 saved.
Day 15: You're a plant. $250 saved.
Day 22: You're a tree. $400 saved.
Day 30: You're a champion. $500 saved.

Users opt-in. We send daily push notifications to motivate them.

"Day 12: You've saved $200! Halfway there! Can you save $20 more today?"

[Point to prizes]
If you complete the challenge, you're entered to win:
- 1st place: $10,000
- 2nd-5th: $1,000 each
- 6th-20th: $100 each

Total prize pool: $24K.

[Point to expected results]
Expected: 5,000 participants. 1,000 complete (20% completion rate).

Impact: Those 1,000 users now have $500 in savings. They're engaged.
They're using the product. They're building a habit.

And habits = retention.

Plus, the 4,000 who didn't complete? They still saved SOMETHING.
Maybe $100, $200. That's $100-200 they didn't have before.

We still helped them. Even if they didn't win.

That's a win for us too.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through the growth visual (seed to tree)
- "$10,000" - big prize, say it big
- "Habits = retention" - show business value
- "We still helped them" - mission-driven

**Transition**: *Click*

## SLIDE 36: CREATIVE CONCEPT 3
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to booth mockup]

"MyBambu en Tu Ciudad" - MyBambu in Your City.

Pop-up events. We're going physical.

[Point to booth design]
10x10 tent. MyBambu green. Banner says "Abre Tu Cuenta Aquí - $30 Bono."
Open your account here - $30 bonus.

Notice: $30. Not the usual $10. We're giving them extra for signing
up in person.

Why? Because they made the effort. They came to us. We reward that.

[Point to activities]
Prize wheel: Spin to win extra bonuses. $5, $10, $25, $50.
Photo booth: MyBambu frame. Take a selfie, post to Instagram, get
an extra entry in the giveaway.
Merch table: T-shirts, tote bags, stickers. Free. People love free stuff.

[Point to locations]
Where do we set up?

Saturday mornings: Mercados, flea markets. Where families shop.

Sundays: Soccer games. Latino leagues. 100+ families watching.

Sundays: After church. (With permission). Families are together,
in good spirits.

Weekends: Quinceañera venues. 200+ guests, all Latino families.

[Point to expected results]
200 signups per event. 4 events per month. That's 800 signups/month.

Cost per event: $2K (booth, staff, bonuses, merch).

Cost per signup: $10. Compare to Facebook ads: $85.

We're 8.5× more efficient.

And the intangible benefit? Brand presence. People SEE us in their
communities. We're not just an app. We're THERE.

That's trust-building you can't measure.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "$30 vs $10" - show we're investing more in person
- List locations (show you've thought this through)
- "8.5× more efficient" - CFO will love this
- "We're THERE" - physical presence matters

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "Do we have staff to run these events?"
- A: "We'll hire local brand ambassadors. $20/hour. 2 staff per
  event. That's in the $2K budget."

[Point to benefits]
What do they get?

- Share your social media profiles.
- 1-minute video: "What MyBambu means to me."

We review applications monthly. Select 10-15 per month until we
hit 50 total.

[Pause]

Think about the leverage here. 50 ambassadors. Each with 5,000
followers on average. That's 250,000 people reached organically.

Zero media cost.

And these aren't influencers we paid for one post. These are
EVANGELISTS. They believe in the mission. They'll promote us
authentically for years.

That's how you build a movement.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "$600/year" - show it's meaningful income
- "Direct line to CEO" - emphasize VIP treatment
- "50 × 5,000 = 250,000 reach" - do the math out loud
- "EVANGELISTS" - emphasize belief over transaction
- "That's how you build a movement" - tie back to mission

[Point to Column 1 - Instagram Post]
Instagram post. Photo of María, our user testimonial. Caption:
"Meet María. Single mom in Houston. MyBambu saves her $300/year.
That's a month of groceries for her kids. What would $300 mean to you?"

Notice the question at the end. We're inviting engagement. Comments.
Shares. People answer the question.

[Point to Column 2 - TikTok Video]
TikTok video. Concept: "POV: Your salary arrives 2 days early."

Show someone checking their bank app. "Wait... it's only Wednesday?"
Then reveal: "MyBambu Direct Deposit = Paid early."

10 seconds. Relatable. Viral potential.

[Point to Column 3 - Instagram Reel]
Instagram Reel. Product demo. "Open a bank account in 2 minutes."

Time-lapse of the signup process. Sped up. Upbeat Latin music.
End screen: "Your turn. Link in bio."

[Pause]

Three different formats. Three different platforms. All driving
the same goal: Signups and engagement.

And we're posting this kind of content DAILY. Building a library.
Building an audience. Building a brand.

```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through all three examples
- "We're inviting engagement" - two-way conversation
- "10 seconds" - emphasize brevity for TikTok
- "DAILY" - consistency matters

[Point to Template 2 - Education]
Education email template.

Header: "MyBambu University" logo. Different brand.

Icon: Graduation cap. Academic vibe.

Large badge: "DOBLE BONOS" - Double bonuses.

Countdown timer: "Expires in 2 days." Urgency.

Red accents: Urgent colors.

CTA: "Claim Bonus Now." Red button. High contrast.

[Pause]

Notice how each template matches its purpose.

Welcome = Positive, encouraging.
Education = Professional, helpful.
Promotion = Urgent, exciting.

That's intentional design.

```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Point to each element (header, CTA, etc.)
- "Intentional design" - this is strategic
- Show how design matches psychology

## SLIDE 40: SUCCESS METRICS
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to dashboard mockup]

This is our marketing performance dashboard. We'll track 6 key metrics.

[Point to each card]

Email Open Rate: Currently 42%. Target was 40%. ✅ On track.
We're exceeding our goal.

SMS Click Rate: 14%. Target was 12%. ✅ Exceeded.
SMS is performing even better than expected.

Referral Rate: 11%. Target is 15%. 🟡 Improving.
We're 73% of the way there. We'll get there.

Social Engagement: 3.8%. Target is 5%. 🟡 Improving.
Close. Need more viral content.

UGC Posts per Month: 38. Target is 50. 🟡 Close.
Users are posting about us, but we need to encourage more.

Event Signups: 185 per event. Target is 200. 🟡 Close.
Almost there. Location matters - some events outperform others.

[Pause]

Overall assessment: We're on track or exceeding on 2 out of 6.
We're close on 4 out of 6.

No red flags. Nothing critically underperforming.

This is healthy progress for Month 1-2.

[Point to update frequency]
We update this dashboard weekly. Every Monday morning. Leadership
gets a Slack notification with the latest numbers.

Transparency. Accountability. That's how we stay on track.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through each metric (don't skip any)
- "✅ Exceeded" - celebrate wins
- "🟡 Close" - show we're aware, not deflecting
- "Transparency. Accountability." - leadership values
- "Weekly updates" - show commitment to tracking

## SLIDE 41: BUSINESS IMPACT
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to line graph]

This is PPC-30 growth over 6 months.

[Trace the line with your finger]

Month 0: Baseline. 1.2 PPC-30. That's where we started.

Month 1: "Tu Primera Semana" launches. 1.4. Small bump. People
are completing onboarding tasks.

Month 2: Referral program launches. 1.7. Bigger jump. Word of
mouth is kicking in.

Month 3: Education series launches. 2.0. Significant growth.
People understand products now. They're activating.

Month 4: Events begin. In-person presence. 2.3. Physical touchpoints
matter.

Month 5: Ambassador program scales. 2.5. Evangelists are spreading
the word.

Month 6: Target achieved. 2.8. We did it.

[Pause]

That's a 133% increase in 6 months.

From 1.2 to 2.8. That's not incremental improvement. That's
transformation.

[Point to annotations]

And notice the annotations. Every milestone corresponds to a
campaign launch. This isn't luck. It's strategy execution.

Cause and effect. We do X, we get Y.

That's what gives me confidence this will work.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Trace the line physically (kinesthetic learning)
- "133% increase" - big number
- "Transformation, not incremental" - emphasize magnitude
- "Cause and effect" - show strategic thinking
- Confidence in your voice (you believe this)

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "What if we don't hit 2.8?"
- A: "Even hitting 2.0 by Month 6 would be a 67% increase. That
  alone would reduce churn by 50% and add $3M in retained LTV.
  We're being ambitious with 2.8, but conservative estimates
  still show massive ROI."

## SLIDE 42: ROI BREAKDOWN
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to table]

Here's the financial summary.

[Read line by line]

Marketing Spend: $124,000 over 6 months.

New Users Acquired: 10,000. That's from all campaigns combined.
Organic signups. Referrals. Events. Influencers.

Average LTV per User: $800. That's our current customer lifetime
value. Multi-product users are worth more, but we're using the
average.

Total LTV: $8,000,000. That's 10,000 users × $800.

[Pause]

ROI: 6,350%.

[Pause longer]

Let me say that differently. For every $1 we spend, we get $64
back in lifetime value.

$1 → $64.

[Point to bar chart]

Look at this visually. Marketing spend is this tiny bar. $124K.
Revenue is this MASSIVE bar. $8M.

That's a 64:1 return.

[Pause]

Now, I know what you're thinking. "That sounds too good to be true."

Fair. Let me address that.

This assumes 10,000 new users. Is that realistic?

[Do math out loud]
Currently we get 500 signups per month. That's 3,000 in 6 months.

With these campaigns, we need to get to 1,667 per month. That's
a 3.3× increase.

Is that achievable? Look at Nubank. They grew 10× in their first
year with similar tactics.

So yes. 3.3× is conservative.

And even if we only hit 5,000 users instead of 10,000? That's
still $4M in LTV. 32:1 ROI.

Still a home run.

```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "$1 → $64" - make this visual (hold up 1 finger, then spread arms wide)
- Long pause after "6,350%" (let it sink in)
- Address skepticism proactively ("too good to be true")
- Show the math (be transparent)
- "Even if we miss by 50%, still a home run" - de-risk the proposal

**Potential Questions**:
- Q: "What if LTV is lower than $800?"
- A: "Fair question. At $400 LTV (50% lower), we'd still have
  16:1 ROI. You'd have to assume LTV drops to $125 for this to
  break even. And at that point, MyBambu has bigger problems
  than marketing."

**Transition**: *Click*
"Here's where the $124K goes..."

## SLIDE 43: BUDGET ALLOCATION
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to pie chart]

$124K over 6 months. Here's the breakdown.

[Point to each slice]

36% - $45K - User Bonuses.
This goes directly to customers. The $3, $5, $25, $10 bonuses we
talked about. This isn't marketing overhead. This is customer acquisition.

19% - $24K - Events.
Pop-up booths, staff, merch, prizes. Physical presence in communities.

10% - $13K - Influencer Partnerships.
Paying micro-influencers to promote us. 10-50 partnerships.

12% - $15K - Social Media Ads.
Facebook, Instagram, TikTok ads. Targeted to Latinos 25-45.

6% - $8K - Content Creation.
Video production, graphic design, copywriting. Professional quality.

5% - $6K - Ambassador Program.
50 ambassadors × $50/month × 6 months. Plus merch.

4% - $5K - Merchandise.
T-shirts, tote bags, stickers for events and ambassadors.

8% - $9K - Tools and Other.
SendGrid, Twilio, analytics tools, contingency.

[Pause]

Notice: 36% goes directly to customers. Not to ad platforms. Not
to agencies. To our USERS.

That's a different philosophy than traditional marketing. We're
sharing the value with the people who matter most.

And that creates goodwill. Loyalty. Evangelism.

You can't buy that. But you can earn it.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through each slice methodically
- "36% to customers" - emphasize this differentiator
- "Different philosophy" - position as innovative
- "You can't buy loyalty" - philosophical point

**Transition**: *Click*
"Here's the timeline..."

## SLIDE 44: TIMELINE & MILESTONES
**Duration**: 1.5 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to Gantt chart]

This is our 6-month execution timeline.

[Point to Month 1]
Month 1: Foundation.
- Tu Primera Semana launches ✅ (already done in concept)
- Social media posts daily ✅
- Influencer outreach begins ⏳ (10 partnerships)

Month 2: Scale.
- Referral program launches ✅
- Bonos Locos week ⏳ (double bonuses promotion)
- Ambassador recruitment ⏳ (goal: 50 people)

Month 3: Educate.
- MyBambu University launches ⏳
- Savings challenge begins ⏳
- Historias Reales video series ⏳

Months 4-6: Events & Optimize.
- Pop-up events in 5 cities ⏳
- A/B test optimizations ⏳
- Scale winning campaigns ⏳

[Point to legend]
✅ = Complete. We've already done the planning.
⏳ = In progress or upcoming.
○ = Not started yet.

[Pause]

Everything is sequenced intentionally. We launch Tu Primera Semana
first because it drives activation. Then referrals to multiply
signups. Then education to improve understanding. Then events to
build community.

It's a crescendo. Each campaign builds on the last.

And by Month 6, all four campaigns are running simultaneously.
That's when we hit maximum momentum.
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- Walk through the timeline chronologically
- "Sequenced intentionally" - show strategic thinking
- "Crescendo" - good metaphor
- "Maximum momentum" - exciting endpoint

**Transition**: *Click*
"So what do we need from you?"

## SLIDE 45: NEXT STEPS & CALL TO ACTION
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to checklist]

Here's what we need to make this happen.

[Read through checklist]

Immediate Actions - This Week:
- [ ] Approve budget: $124K.
- [ ] Hire 1 additional Spanish content writer.
- [ ] Set up SendGrid and Twilio accounts.
- [ ] Design email templates (work with design team).
- [ ] Write first week of email copy.

Month 1 Actions:
- [ ] Launch Tu Primera Semana campaign.
- [ ] Post daily on Instagram (5 posts/week).
- [ ] Reach out to 10 micro-influencers.
- [ ] Launch referral program.

[Point to key decision]
Key Decision Needed: Go/No-Go by [INSERT DATE].

We're ready to execute. We have the strategy. We have the creative.
We have the timeline.

What we need from this room is three things:

One: Budget approval. $124K over 6 months. CFO, can you commit?

Two: Headcount approval. 1 Spanish content writer. CPO, can you
allocate?

Three: Executive sponsorship. CEO, will you champion this internally?

[Pause]

If we get those three yeses today, we can launch in 2 weeks.

If we wait another quarter, we lose momentum. Our competitors
aren't waiting. Nubank isn't waiting. Chime isn't waiting.

We need to move now.

[Pause]

So I'll ask directly:

[Look at CEO]
Are we ready to do this?
```

**Body Language**:
- Stand tall, confident
- Make direct eye contact with CEO
- Open palm gesture (inviting)
- Don't sit down until they respond

**Key Emphasis**:
- "We're ready" - show confidence
- Three clear asks (budget, headcount, sponsorship)
- "Competitors aren't waiting" - urgency
- Ask directly (don't hide behind corporate speak)
- Long pause after "Are we ready?" - wait for response

**Potential Responses**:

If YES:
"Thank you. Let's make it happen. I'll send next steps to everyone
in this room by EOD today. Let's build the bank our community deserves."

If MAYBE:
"What concerns can I address? I'm happy to dive deeper into any
part of this plan."

If NO:
"I understand. Can you help me understand the blocker? Is it
budget, timing, or strategy?"

---

## SLIDE 46: BRAND GUIDELINES
**Duration**: 30 seconds (if asked)

**What to Say**:
```
Quick overview of our brand guidelines.

Colors: MyBambu Green (#00D4AA) is our primary. Navy Blue for
secondary. Success green for positive indicators.

Typography: Poppins for headlines. Inter for body text. Clean,
modern, readable.

Tone: Warm, friendly, empowering. We talk TO people, not AT them.
Like a friend who wants to help you succeed.

Icons: Palm tree is our signature. We use it as a watermark
throughout our materials.
```

our brand voice?"

---

## SLIDE 47: COMPETITOR ANALYSIS
**Duration**: 1 minute (if asked)

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to matrix]

Here's how we differentiate from competitors.

Latino-first: Only MyBambu. Nubank and Chime aren't built FOR
Latinos specifically. We are.

Spanish app: Only MyBambu. 72% of our users prefer Spanish. We
honor that.

Remittances: Only MyBambu. Sending money to Mexico, Colombia,
Venezuela. That's a core use case for our community.

Education: We do it. Nubank does some. Chime doesn't.

Community: We're building it intentionally. Others have users,
we have a movement.

Our positioning: "The bank built BY Latinos, FOR Latinos."

That's not just marketing. It's truth.
```

**When to use**: If someone asks "Why would someone choose us
over Nubank or Chime?"

---

## SLIDE 48: TESTIMONIAL QUOTES
**Duration**: 30 seconds (if asked)

**What to Say**:
```
[Point to quote wall]

Real quotes from real users. Five stars across the board.

"MyBambu changed my life" - María, Houston.

"Finally, a bank that speaks Spanish" - Carlos, LA.

"I save $25 every month now" - Sofia, Miami.

These aren't cherry-picked. These are representative. We have
hundreds more like this.

The product works. People love it. We just need to tell that story
at scale.

That's what these campaigns do.
```

**When to use**: If someone asks "Do customers actually like us?"
or "Do we have social proof?"

---

## SLIDE 49: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
**Duration**: 2 minutes (if asked)

**What to Say**:
```
[Go through each Q&A]

Q: "What if users don't engage with emails?"

A: We have backup channels. SMS, push notifications, in-app messages.
Multi-channel strategy. Plus, we're testing subject lines and send
times to optimize open rates.

Q: "What if bonuses attract fraud?"

A: We have fraud detection. Max 1 account per SSN, device ID, and
IP address. Bonuses are delayed 3 days for manual review. We'll
catch suspicious activity.

Q: "What if Spanish translations are wrong?"

A: Every piece of Spanish copy is reviewed by a native speaker.
We test with real users before launch. Authenticity is non-negotiable.

Q: "What's our contingency if ROI is low?"

A: Month 3 checkpoint. If we're not seeing progress toward 2.0 PPC,
we pivot. We double down on winning campaigns, cut losing ones.
Agile approach.
```

**When to use**: Anytime someone raises these concerns. Have
these answers ready.
